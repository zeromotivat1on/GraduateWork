# Overview
This project will contain some procedural generation implementation instances\
They will consists of the following ones:
- [ ] Life Simulation
- [ ] Fire Simulation
### Technical Part
The project is written using the following technologies:
- `C++`
- `SDL 2.0`
# Prerequisites
The project already has installed `SDL` library for `x64` Windows\ \
If you have `x32` Windows, then go to [Official Download Page](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)\
Here you will find several possible variants to download `SDL`\ \
In addition, you should install [MingW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) and [GNU Make](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)\ \
The project was built in VSCode, so you would probably consider to install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) as well\
# Launch
To launch an app just run `make` command in PowerShell in one of the following ways:
```
make
make install
```
If there are no compilation errors - gratz.\
Now you can simply run the newly created `.exe` file (`procedural_generation.exe` for now)
